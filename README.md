# Progressive-Budget

### Description

This repo contains a Budget Tracker. The Budget Tracker code is from an already-existing project. This project enhances the Budget Tracker code to include online/offline functionality.

The new functionality allows the user to add expenses and deposits to their budget both online and offline. While offline the user can enter transactions and the table and chart will still update. Once they are brought back online, the pending offline entries are posted to the server.
